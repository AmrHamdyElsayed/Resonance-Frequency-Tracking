# Resonance-Frequency-Tracking
In this project I created a python nscript to control SR810 DSP Lock-In Amplifier (LIA) side by side with Keysight 81150A function generator to extract the resonance frequency of Quartz tuning forks (QTF) based on Beat frequency scheme. 
the SR810 LIA has a maximum sampling rate of 512 sample/s beside an internal buffer that can store up to 8100 samples.
